Spazio Hamilton â€” Static site (placeholder content)

This archive contains a simple multi-page static site designed for deployment on GitHub Pages. It uses a grayscale retro aesthetic and includes the provided stylized image of Margaret Hamilton as the central visual.

What you'll find:
- index.html (Homepage)
- blog.html (Blog listing)
- events.html (Events listing)
- contact.html (Contact form; replace the Formspree action URL in the form with your form endpoint)
- post-sample.html (Sample article page)
- css/style.css (Stylesheet using VT323 Google Font)
- js/scripts.js (Small helper script)
- images/hamilton.png (Uploaded image)

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for a user site: username.github.io; for a project site: any name).
2. Upload the files to the repository root (or the gh-pages branch).
3. For the contact form to work, configure a Formspree endpoint (https://formspree.io) and replace the action attribute in contact.html with your form endpoint.
4. Optional: if you prefer Markdown-based posts and automatic generation, migrate these templates into a Jekyll structure (this code is intentionally simple to keep the site static).

Replace all placeholder copy with your real content and you are good to go.
